1. Write a python program that prints odd numbers between 0 and 100.


        for number in range(0,101):
                    if number % 2 != 0:
                                print(number)


2. Modify the program in question 1 to print even numbers between 0 and 100.


for number in range(0, 101):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)


3. Write a Python program that prints list of numbers which are exactly divisible by
11 between 2000 and 3300 (both included).


for number in range(2000,3301):
    if number % 11 == 0:
        print(number)


4. Define a function “checkOccurence(list, item)” that can take in two arguments
called list and item. Return the number of times the item occurs in the list. e.g:
“checkOccurence([5,3,3,1,4,7,9,1,2,9], 9)” should return 2 (because 9 appears 2
times in the list).


def checkOccurence(list,item):
    occurences = 0
    for number in list:
        if number == item:
            occurences += 1
        
    return occurences
print(checkOccurence([5,3,3,1,4,7,9,1,2,9],9))

5. Define a Python function “findPrimeNumbers(N)” that takes in one argument N.
Return the list of prime numbers between 0 and N(inclusive.) E.g“findPrimeNumbers(6)” should return [1, 2, 3, 5]. Using Python comments syntax,
add comments​​ to describe the flow of execution of the program .


#function to find the prime numbers between 0 and a given number 
def findPrimeNumbers(N):
    #list to hold the prime numbers
    list = []
    #counter to hold the number of factors per number in the list
    counter = 0
    #iterate through the numbers
    for number in range(0,(N +1)):
        #for each number , we check for factors between 1 and N
        for i in range(1,N+1):
            if number % i == 0 :
                #if a factor is found , increment the counter
                counter += 1
        #if the number of factors is less than or equal to 2 ( i.e it is only divisible by itself and 1 ) , it is a prime number and it is added to the list
        if counter == 2:
            list.append(number)
        #reset the counter for each number
        counter = 0           
     #return list containing the prime numbers   
    return list
print(findPrimeNumbers(6))
